# Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments
# ----------------------------------------

"""
For example, consider a function that builds a pizza. It needs to accept a
number of toppings, but you canâ€™t know ahead of time how many toppings
a person will want. The function in the following example has one parameter,
*toppings, but this parameter collects as many arguments as the calling
line provides:
"""

# The * symbol will creates a tuple name toppings
def make_pizza(*toppings):
	
	print("\nMake a pizza with the following toppings: ")
	for each_topping in toppings:
		print("- " + each_topping)

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')


"""
The asterisk in the parameter name *toppings tells Python to make an
empty tuple called toppings and pack whatever values it receives into this
tuple. The print statement in the function body produces output showing
that Python can handle a function call with one value and a call with three
values. It treats the different calls similarly. Note that Python packs the
arguments into a tuple, even if the function receives only one value:
"""


# ('pepperoni',)
# ('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
