INHERITANCE: if a class you writing contains things from the 
previous class, inheritance can be used. when one class inherits 
from another class, the original class is a parent class and the 
new class is a child class. the child class inherits every attibute
and method from the parent class but it is also free to define its
own new attributes and methods
